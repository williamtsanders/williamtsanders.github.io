                <p>I'm William Turner Sanders. Go by Will. I've lived in NYC since June of 2019. Before, I lived in Houston, and for a short time, abroad in Ahmadi, Kuwait. I've worked in the oil field, country club kitchens, the massage industry, and now in tech. But most importantly, I study at the Circle in the Square Theatre School, three floors under the Cirle in the Square Theatre, Broadway. Acting has been my true love since boyhood, and I am very thankful for the opportunity to study at such a fine school. I also sing, and play the banjo.</p>

                <p>
                All that being said, I really love to code! It makes anyone who can do it feel like a wizard. What kid didn't want cast spells when they were young? Really anything creative and challenging grabs my interest. </p>

                I have been practicing Zen Buddhism for three years. In 2019, I attended a silent Zen-7 retreat, an ancient practice designed to teach its participants the nature of their true mind. At the end, I recieved my Dharma name, "Fei Wei," which means power. It's all together fitting. After all, where there's a Will, there's a Wei. </p>

                <p>
                I also am involved in the Burning Man arts festival. Such an aruous, soul-lifting experience dedicated to creativity has really inspired and informed my decisions. For me, creativity comes first. My mind is as much a tool as it is a vessel for experience. </p>

                I hope you have enjoyed my website. Please enjoy a poem from my favorite poet, William Shakespeare.</p>
