sample AboutMe Site

Current functionality includes:
    REST fetch in the poem module
    mailto: link in the contact module
    BootStrap implementation across site

Color Scheme based off my favorite painter, Rene Magritte

Had I more time I would
    Add media queries to make the flow better on multiple devices
    Use php and a small email server to have a static form on the contact page
    Host a resume download page
    Pick the sonnet you would like to read instead of just random ones
    Add CSS animations in the style of Magritte
