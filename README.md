sample AboutMe Site

Current functionality includes:
   ~ REST fetch in the poem module ~ One thing to note is that it works while locally hosted. However the API does not have an    ~ SSL cert, and the module is not working on gitHub for this reason
   ~ mailto: link in the contact module
   ~ BootStrap implementation across site

Design Choices
   ~ Color Scheme based off my favorite painter, Rene Magritte
   ~ Sticky Header
   ~ Hover Enabled buttons in the navbar

Had I more time I would:
   ~ Add media queries to make the flow better on multiple devices
   ~ Use php and a small email server to have a static form on the contact page
   ~ Host a resume download page
   ~ Pick the sonnet you would like to read instead of just random ones
   ~ Add CSS animations in the style of Magritte
   ~ Get the poem module working over HTTPS
